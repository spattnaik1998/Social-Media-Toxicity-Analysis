Sentiment analysis: Used bidirectional LSTM to analyze social media comments and classify them based on the malignant nature of these comments. Explored different hyperparameter tuning methods by changing learning rate and Optimizer. Evaluated Model Performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Neural Network Architecture: Preprocessed the data using Tokenization and Embedding techniques. Trained the model using different Optimizers (Adam, SGD, and AdaGrad) and learning rates (0.1, 0.01). The Fully connected layer composed of one layer of 128 units and ReLU activation function, the second fully connected layer of 256 units with ReLU activation function and Batch Normalization and a third layer of 128 units and ReLU activation function. Finally layer comprised of 6 output units and sigmoid activation function.

Model Evaluation: The following metrics were used to evaluate the performace of model: Precision, Recall, Accuracy, AUC, False Positive, False Negative
